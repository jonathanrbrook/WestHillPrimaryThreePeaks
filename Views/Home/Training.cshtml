    <p>Training walks will be happening during 2012 and 2013 and will be posted in our <a href="@Href("~/Home/TrainingDates")">calendar</a>. All are welcome to come along and join in.</p>

    <p>The aim is for 'Regular' i.e.. Monthly, evening walks to be organised  
        over the course of the summer with both the distance and 'difficulty' gradually increasing each time. 
        These will initially be largely SW coastal footpath based with the expectation being that as many of the walking team attend as possible 
        although clearly it will be difficult to agree dates when all eighteen of us are able to attend. 
        The intention is that as we move towards November, we move onto Dartmoor and beyond (these will be weekend walks).</p>
